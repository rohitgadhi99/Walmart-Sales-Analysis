## Project Overview

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/rohitgadhi99/Walmart-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Walmart%20dashboard%20page1.png)

This is an end-to-end data analysis project designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions and eventually visualized the results using Power BI. The project helped me hone my skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Google Colab, Power BI, SQL (MySQL)
   - **API Setup**: To download a Kaggle dataset using its API in Google Colab, you'll first need to install the Kaggle API, upload your Kaggle API token (kaggle.json), and then use the API to download the desired                      dataset. Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data
